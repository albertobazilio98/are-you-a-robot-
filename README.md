# Are You a Robot?

Are you a robot? is a chatbot with the purpose of studying artificial intelligences that are capable of interpreting natural language and carrying out sentiment analysis.

The bot learns through baysean networks and porter stemming to associate text with sentiments through reactions with discord emojis.

The bot currently works primarily with Brazilian Portuguese, it also works with other languages, but the results may not be as expected
